									<h2><a href="#">WHO AM I?<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>My name is Sayuj Stephen. I am currently a third year Mechanical Engineering Student at the University of Calgary. Over the past three years I've been curious about different things and tried my hands at projects to further develop my understanding and have some fun. Below is the culmination of those projects</p>

										<h2><a href="#">ESP 32 GARDEN<br />
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>After making a Garden using the Arduino Uno, this was my first project using the ESP 32 microcontroller. I was able to use this microcontroller to control a water pump, along with lights and monitor temperature and humidity coniditons of the soil.</p>
									<h3> Future Plans </h3>
									<p>I plan to utilize the ESP 32's bluetooth compatibility to design an app where the lights and watering features can be controlled using the app and all soil information can be displayed directly into the app.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Arduino Mega Game Console<br />
					
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project I utilized the Arduino mega and Arduino mega libraries to design game that can be played on this console. Designed using SolidWorks.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Blinds Brackets <br />
				
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Part designed for Stephens Blinds & Shades this is a bracket attachment for Korean Zebra Blinds. Through careful measurement and multiple design iterations these serve as a perfect replacemetn for existing brackets. However their structural intergrity due to 3D printing is volatile and I am currently in the process of trying out 
										new materials in an effort to improve strength and durability of the parts.

										<h2><a href="#">ESP 32 ROVER<br />
										
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Currently my biggest project yet. This project aims to utilize the ESP32 to its full extent, controlling 4 independent motors using motor controllers. This aim of this project
										is to create a rover that can be remotely controlled but also traverse its environment autonomously. Currently the rover is able to move thanks to a connection with a joystick.

										<h2><a href="#">RC CAR<br />
						
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This is the latest iteration of the RC car. Unfortunately due to a bug I lost most of the files to the orignal version of the RC car. Currently this model aims to integrate metal gears into the system to
										improve the logevity of the system as the previous model had used plastic gears which did not last long due to the high RPM of the motors.

										<h2><a href="#">Modified LAMP<br />
										primis vestibulum</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This is my first attempt at creating parts for 3D printing and designing for manufacture. I designed these components to hold the light bar that is attached ot hte monitor as show above. 
										These parts also require no supports to 3D print and as such can be scaled and mass produced if required.
